## Building with CSS and Vanilla DOM manipulation

Here is a fun little music making project. It started as an idea to emulate a kids bright colored plastic keyboard. As I build it out it started to evolve. 

Have fun with it! 

## Future enhancements: 

-Have users login and add their own wav files
-Develop a way to record a session
-Drag and drop wav file upload
-Ability for users to add to the wav file sample collection
-Engineer a feed for users to share their sessions
